# Generating_3D_Shaped_and_Swiss_ROll_for_Manifold_Learning
Generated two types of datasets: 3D S-shape and Swiss Roll. Plot the 3D visualization of both datasets then apply manifold learning methods like Isomap, Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding(LLE) to obtain new “unrolled” data on the 2D space.
